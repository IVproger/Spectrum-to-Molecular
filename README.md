# Molecular Structure Prediction from Spectral Data  
*Hybrid AI Methods for Automated Analysis*

Welcome to our research project repository. This project aims to develop an **interpretable AI system** that integrates deep learning methods—including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), diffusion models, and transformer architectures—with classical chemical analysis. Our objective is to automatically reconstruct molecular structures from mass spectrometry data and generate reaction mechanism hypotheses.

---

## Project Overview

**Key Goals:**

- **Automated Structure Reconstruction:**  
  Develop algorithms to predict molecular structures from mass spectra with high accuracy (≥85% Tanimoto similarity).

- **Reaction Mechanism Hypothesis:**  
  Generate and visualize fragmentation trees to propose reaction mechanisms.

- **Hybrid Methodologies:**  
  Combine:
  - **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** To model chemical bonds and molecular fragmentation.
  - **Diffusion Models:** To generate molecular structures under chemical constraints.  
    The *DiffMS* module—integrated from the Coley Group’s work—is a core component in this approach. For more details, see the [DiffMS GitHub repository](https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.git) and the associated [arXiv publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571). citeturn0file0
  - **Transformer Architectures:** To analyze complex spectral patterns.

- **Integration with Analytical Tools:**  
  Enhance processing speed and precision by integrating with established platforms (e.g., RMG-Py, SIRIUS).

## Project Components

### 1. Data Preparation  
- **Data Collection:**  
  Aggregate and annotate spectral datasets from open sources (MONA, HMDB, NIST, GNPS) including SMILE structures and metadata.  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  Implement pipelines to clean, normalize, and structure spectral data for downstream analysis.

### 2. Algorithm Development  
- **Baseline Model (Mass2SMILES):**  
  Start with an initial molecular structure prediction model.  
- **Hybrid Architecture:**  
  Build on the baseline by integrating GNNs and diffusion models (via the DiffMS module) to create a robust and interpretable system.

### 3. Validation & Integration  
- **Evaluation:**  
  Test models using metrics such as Tanimoto similarity, MCES, and functional group prediction accuracy.
- **Tool Integration:**  
  Link our system with analytical tools (e.g., RMG-Py, SIRIUS) for improved performance.
